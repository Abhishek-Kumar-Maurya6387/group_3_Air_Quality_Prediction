# Linear Regression Analysis

This repository contains a basic implementation of the **Linear Regression** algorithm using Python. It demonstrates how to analyze and visualize data using popular Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most commonly used algorithms for predictive modeling. This project focuses on applying linear regression to a dataset, visualizing relationships, and interpreting the results.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is:
- **Filename:** `239af6f4-692a-4346-9038-940d9e68942a.csv`
- **Description:** (Provide a brief description of the dataset once you’ve uploaded and reviewed it)
- ![input 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ac11cf2-d39c-4c32-ab68-6a5bca9e8964)


## 🧰 Libraries Used

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: For basic plotting and visualizations.
- **seaborn**: For enhanced statistical graphics.

## 🧠 Algorithm

The following steps were used in this project:

1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Perform data preprocessing.
3. Visualize the data to identify patterns.
4. Apply a Linear Regression model.
5. Evaluate the model's performance.
